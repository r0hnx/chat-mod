## Stream Processing for Twitch Chat Moderation

**Company:** Twitch

**Problem:** Twitch, a live streaming platform, experiences massive volumes of chat messages during popular streams. Moderating this constant stream of chat messages for inappropriate content is crucial to maintaining a positive and safe environment for viewers and streamers. However, manually reviewing every message is impossible, and traditional batch processing approaches can't keep up with the real-time nature of chat.

**Challenge:** Design and implement a large data stream processing system for Twitch chat moderation. This system should be able to:

* **Process millions of chat messages per minute** in real-time with minimal latency.
* **Identify and flag potentially harmful messages** based on pre-defined rules (e.g., containing hate speech, threats, or spam).
* **Alert moderators** about flagged messages for further review and potential action.
* **Learn and adapt over time** by incorporating feedback from human moderators to improve the accuracy of flagging potentially harmful content.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The system should be **scalable** to handle the ever-growing volume of chat messages on Twitch.
* It should be **fault-tolerant** to ensure continuous operation even if individual processing nodes fail.
* The system should respect user privacy and ensure **data security**.

**Success Metrics:**

* Percentage of harmful messages identified and flagged for review.
* Reduction in response time for moderators to address flagged messages.
* Improvement in user experience by maintaining a safe and positive chat environment.
